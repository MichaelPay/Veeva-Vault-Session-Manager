    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 2024-12-03</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Veeva Vault Session Manager Chrome extension ("the Extension") is designed to help users manage their Veeva Vault sessions by displaying cookie, session, and user information directly within the browser. This Privacy Policy outlines how the Extension handles user data and ensures the protection of your information.</p>

    <h2>Information Collected</h2>
    <p>The Extension collects the following information locally within your browser:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Specifically, the Extension accesses cookies named <code>JSESSIONID</code>, <code>TK</code>, and <code>veevaUserSsoSettings</code> from domains related to Veeva Vault (e.g., <code>*.veevavault.com</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>Session Storage Data:</strong> User session information stored within the browser's session storage for Veeva Vault domains.</li>
        <li><strong>User Information:</strong> User ID and username extracted from session data to display within the Extension interface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    <p>The information collected by the Extension is used solely for the purpose of displaying session and user details to you within the Extension interface. This allows you to manage your Veeva Vault sessions more effectively.</p>

    <h2>Data Transmission</h2>
    <p><strong>No data collected by the Extension is transmitted to any external servers or third parties.</strong> All data processing and display occur locally within your browser.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>The Extension does not store or retain any personal data beyond the current browser session. All information is accessed in real-time and displayed directly to you without permanent storage.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The Extension requires certain permissions to function correctly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cookies Permission:</strong> To access and read specific cookies associated with your Veeva Vault sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Tabs Permission:</strong> To query open tabs for Veeva Vault domains to retrieve session storage data.</li>
        <li><strong>Host Permissions:</strong> Access to <code>https://*.veevavault.com/*</code> to read session storage and interact with Veeva Vault pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are necessary for the core functionality of the Extension and are not used for any other purposes.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>The Extension prioritizes the security of your data by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Processing all data locally within your browser.</li>
        <li>Not transmitting any data over the internet.</li>
        <li>Using standard Chrome extension security practices to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Extension does not use or integrate with any third-party services that could access your data.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
